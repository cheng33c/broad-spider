continues to be dominated by financiers, hedge funders and property
tycoons.

think of their animals as members of the family and are willing to
spend big to prove it, making it a lucrative industry.

绝不要低估人们到底有多爱他们的宠物。大多数的主人都把他们的宠物当作是家庭的一份子、并且乐意在它们身上投入大量资金，这就形成了一个赚钱的行业。

of all bakery products eaten in the UK are produced by them.

1950s, sterile and watertight containers were seen as a novel

if a similar system would work for milk, according to the New York
Times.
