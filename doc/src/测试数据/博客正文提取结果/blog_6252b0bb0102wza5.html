1. Plan Your Clothes


想想穿什么


Do you remember when
you were in elementary school and
your mother would lay
your outfit out
the night
before? Well, there was a method to mom’s madness. People often
waste unnecessary time looking through their closets each morning,
but you can eliminate that step altogether. On nights where you
know you have an early morning commute coming up in mere hours,
just grab an outfit and lay it on the floor, or hang it over the
back of a chair. Something. Anything. If you make that part of your
routine each night, you’ll easily shave 5 to 10 minutes off of your
routine every morning.


还记得你在小学的时候，你的妈妈会在前一天的晚上，把第二天要穿的衣服拿出来？好吧，这是母亲的强迫症。每天早晨，人们通常浪费很多不必要的时间来把他们衣橱都看上一遍，但是你其实可以少做这一步，把它整合，只需在晚上提前意识到还有短短几个小时天就要亮了，抓一件衣服放在地板上或者挂在椅子靠背上，等等。任何事情，只要你把它变成晚上要做的一种习惯，那么每天早晨你就可以很容易的节省出5到10分钟的时间。


2. Hold Off On Your Phone Use


不要一早上就用手机


These days, people often grab their phones within seconds of their
eyes opening each morning. In fact, more people likely do that than
don’t. As if some imperative email,
text or tweet was sent at 5 A.M. Either way, we get it. That’s the
new way of 
the world. We collectively want
to be plugged in at all times, and perhaps no time more so than
directly after waking up. Use that as a mental incentive. If you
tell yourself that you’re not allowed to check your phone until
after you’ve showered, you’d be shocked at how
little procrastinating you’ll
do. Lying in bed and watching that early morning talk show isn’t as
alluring if it’s preventing you from checking Facebook.


现如今，人们早上眼睛一睁开，通常几秒钟内就开始抓着自己的手机。事实上，这么做的人比不这么做的人还要多。要是有什么紧急邮件，短信，或是推送，等等，我们能够理解。这是世界上一个新型的沟通方式。我们总是想一直沉溺其中，所以就是迟迟赖在床上不起来的原因。可以用头脑激励的方法，对自己说如果你不起来冲淋，那你就不能看的的手机，你会惊讶的发现自己一点都没有拖延。如果要是不让你看自己的脸书，那么躺在床上看晨间脱口秀节目也没有什么诱惑力。


3. Crank Some
Music


放一些音乐


Once you’re up and out of bed, the faster you hit play on an
up-tempo playlist the
better. The sooner your toes are naturally tapping, the sooner
you’re awake and ready
to take on the day. You know why athletes listen to music before
heading out onto their battlefield of choice? It’s because the
right song can get your endorphins going.


一旦你起床，你可以放一些快节奏的音乐，越快效果越好。不就你就会发现你的脚趾自然而然的打起节奏，再过一会，你就彻底清醒然后准备好迎接新的一天。你知道为什么运动员在去训练场之前要听音乐么？那就是因为你要是听对音乐你体内的胺多酚就会上升。


4. Don't Just Drink Water


不要只喝水


When someone is passed out in the movies, you may see someone dump
some cold water on them, or even toss them into a running shower.
Why? Because that actually does help to wake you up and get you
going. Shock the system with a massive splash of cold water to the
face, preferably after achieving that perfect office look with the
BIC® Flex 5® and its
precision
edging blade. 
The splash of cold water right after a shave will absolutely help
knock the early morning cobwebs off, and it’ll do so pretty darn
quick.


当有人在电影中的时候昏了过去，你可能会看到其他人在他们的身上浇水，甚至将他们全身浇透像洗澡那样。为什么？因为这样你帮助你清醒并且恢复意识。在你的脸上冲凉水可以刺激你的神经系统，想要在办公室呈现一个好的面貌，可以用BIC®
Flex
5®剃须刀和它精密微刃，在刮脸以后用冷水冲洗，能够完全去除造成的蛛网（胡须），虽然它还是会很快再结起来。


5. Fresh Air


新鲜的空气


If you’re lucky enough to have a balcony that’s attached to your
bedroom, use it. Each morning, while you’re in
that groggy, 
post-slumber state, step outside and take a big ol’ breath. In
fact, for a one-two wake-up punch, you may want to enjoy your
morning cup of coffee out there. Never underestimate the power of
some fresh air — especially in the fall or early spring when you
could describe the temperature as being “crisp.”


如果你的卧室正好连接这一个阳台的话，那很幸运，要利用它。每天早晨，当你睡意朦胧，恍恍惚惚的时候，走去阳台然后尽情呼吸。永远不要小觑新鲜空气的能量，特别是秋天以及早春，你会把温度形容成“清新的”。


6. It's All About The Smell


气味可以唤醒一切


Those old coffee commercials you might remember from childhood were
actually pretty dead-on. If you wake up and smell coffee, you’ll
innately crave a cup. In fact, you may want a cup right now just
after reading that last sentence. Coffee has a way of tempting you.
Let it. Preset your coffee maker and allow yourself to give in to
its seductive aroma each and every morning. If you sleep close
enough to your kitchen, you may not even need an alarm clock. Just
follow your nose.


那些老的咖啡广告，完全可以让你回忆起你年代久远的童年。如果你早晨起来闻到咖啡香，你就会想来一杯。事实上，正好在阅读将近最后一句时，你可能会想来一杯咖啡。咖啡就有一种吸引你的力量，那就让它发挥作用。提前设置好你的咖啡机，每天早晨让美妙的咖啡香弥漫。如果你睡觉的地方靠近厨房，那就更好了，连闹钟都不需要。让鼻子把你叫醒把。


7. No Sugary Breakfasts


不含糖的早餐


Here’s the thing about syrup-soaked pancakes, coffee cakes and
muffins…they’re delicious. They really are and there’s no arguing
that fact. But at the same time, why the hell are they mostly
marketed as breakfast foods? What makes a blueberry strudel any
different than a slice of blueberry pie? Nothing! And, guys, we’re
sorry, but there’s really no good way to justify eating a pie
equivalent at 9 A.M. Eat a breakfast packed with protein, not
one composed of sugar.


有枫糖淋煎饼、咖啡味的蛋糕和玛芬蛋糕，他们都很好吃，真的无可厚非。但是同时，为什么它们都作为早饭来营销。那蓝莓馅饼和蓝莓派的区别是什么？它们没差！同志们，我们很抱歉，没有好的方法来判断在上午九点这些馅饼的等价物的好坏。早饭应该要含有蛋白质，而不仅仅是含糖。


8. Ice Cold Water


冰冷的水


While caffeine does its job and does it well, there’s actually
another liquid that you should be drinking right after waking up
each morning. Water. Yes, forget the fancy coffee; unbeknownst to
most, slamming a tall glass of water actually helps to activate
your brain even faster than coffee. Right after you wake up, pour
yourself a glass, chug it down, then hop into the shower. By the
time you’re out, you’re naturally alert, awake and ready to go. You
might want a cup of coffee, both for the added boost and for
routine’s sake, but you may not need it.


咖啡因能够很好的显示自己的效果，而且效果不错的话。那还有一种液体你也应该一早上就饮用。水，是的，忘了美妙的咖啡，最不为人知的是，喝下一大杯水，能够帮你的大脑恢复活力，效果比咖啡还要好。就在你醒来之后，灌自己一杯水，大口喝下，然后跳去淋浴。在你出门的时候，你自然清醒，准备上路。你可能想要一杯咖啡，想要额外的刺激加上平时的习惯，但你（的身体）可能不需要。


9. The More Annoying The Better


越吵越好


This one is pretty simple. When setting your alarm, never use a
song that you’re a fan of, as many people often do. In fact, don’t
use any sound that’s even close to being sonically pleasing.
There’s a reason that the default iPhone alarm sound is as grating
as it is. That’s because regardless of how early it is, or how out
of it you are, you damn sure want to make that infuriating sound
stop as soon as possible. At the end of the day, that’s what you
need in an alarm clock —
horrid annoyance.


这一条很简单，当你设置闹钟铃声的时候，不要用你喜欢的某一首歌做闹铃，虽然很多人都喜欢这么做。事实上，最好都不用悦耳的声音做闹铃。这就是为什么Iphone默认的闹钟铃声是那么的刺耳。因为不管多早，或者闹钟离你多远，你只要一听到这么令人不悦的声音，你就会想立刻关掉它，在一天结束之前，你需要把你的闹钟铃声变得刺耳吵人。


10. The "Far Away Alarm" Trick


把闹钟放远


The problem with alarm clocks is that they come with a snooze
button. So while you’re in your most groggy state, you’re literally
being given the option to make that infuriating sound cease to
exist. Hell, you probably know your wake-up routine so well that
you could hit snooze while your eyes are still shut. Do yourself a
favor and remove that all-too-easy option. Take it out of the
equation. Place your alarm clock so far away that it necessitates
you actually getting out of your bed to stop it. Once you’re
standing up, you likely won’t want to
hit snooze, and
will want a cup of coffee instead.


现在闹钟都有小睡按钮，这是个问题。当你睡意正酣，下意识就会选择这个功能让闹铃暂停。真糟糕，你对自己起床习惯是这么了解，都不需要睁开眼睛就可以开启小睡功能。那就给自己帮个小忙，清除所有快捷键，让它们都不能使用。把你的闹钟放到远一点的地方，远到需要你从床上起来才能关掉它。一旦你起来了以后，你就不想再去选择小睡功能了，而是想要一杯咖啡。
