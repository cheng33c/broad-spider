You want to know the secret to success? Here it is:


你想知道成功的秘诀吗？下面我就告诉你：


Believe in yourself so much, that no one else can tell
you otherwise.


要足够相信自己，这样就没有人能对你指手画脚了。


Also doubt

yourself so much, that you feel like no matter how hard you work
nothing could
ever
get you to your goal.


也要足够怀疑自己，总是感觉无论自己多么努力，好像也永远无法实现目标。


Work so hard, that your friends think you're crazy.


工作要足够努力，让朋友都觉得你疯了。


Be ridiculed,
be shunned, be ignored, be told no. Get shut down
so many times that you
become immune to
it. That it drives you, and gives you energy.


被嘲笑、被回避、被忽视、被泼冷水、被阻止的次数多了，你就习惯了，这些都是你的动力，能给你力量。


Set boundaries for yourself. IE don't spend your money going to
every show.


为自己设定界限。也就是说不要花钱把所有演出都看了。


Also, go get inspired. Take yourself out of your work cycle, remind
yourself why you are working yourself to the bone.


而且要寻找启发。从日复一日的工作中抽出身来，提醒自己拼命工作是为了什么。


Give EVERYTHING to your craft. If there's someone in your life or
something you do that prevents you from working 25 hours a day, get
rid of it.


全身心投入工作。如果生活中有人或事妨碍你一天工作25小时，就把他们赶出你的生活。


Ingrain the idea in your mind that NOTHING will get you where you
want to be other than hard work.


头脑中要有一个根深蒂固的想法，那就是只有努力工作才能帮你实现目标。


Keep working so hard, that eventually what you are doing isn't
work. It's who you are. And now people are taking notice. Your
parents believe in you; your friends support you.


坚持努力工作，最终你不是在做工作，而是在做人。人们都会注意你，家人会信任你，朋友会支持你。


Keep doubting yourself. Always know that there's something else
better out there that you have to keep working harder than you did
yesterday to achieve.


要一直自我怀疑。你要知道前方总是有比你昨天已经实现的目标更好的东西等待你去为之努力。


Enjoy yourself. Be happy. Be grateful, be humble.


享受生活，要开心、感恩、谦卑。


Keep working your ass off so you can make every single day of your
life as good as this one, and better than the day before
it.


拼命工作，你才能使每天都这么美好，每天都比前一天更美好。
