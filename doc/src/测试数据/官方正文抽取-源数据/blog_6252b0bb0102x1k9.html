1989年的夏天，总统夫妇因工作而相遇。米歇尔25岁提前从哈佛毕业，成为芝加哥法律事务所的一名律师。当时奥巴马是暑期实习生，米歇尔成为了他的导师。（英大：所以是一段师生恋？！！）作为导师的米歇尔邀请奥巴马共进晚餐。奥巴马很快就被米歇尔的睿智和美丽所吸引。没过多久，他就开始追求米歇尔了。


At first, Michelle said she expected her advisee, then a Harvard
Law student, to be "nerdy, strange, off-putting." But he surprised
her.


一开始，米歇尔觉得这个来自哈佛法学院的学生，有些“呆蠢、奇怪，让人讨厌。”但是他（之后的表现）却惊艳到了她。


"I was charmed," she told Chicago Magazine. "I was pleasantly
surprised by who he turned out to be."


“我被他深深吸引，”她告诉《芝加哥杂志》，“他真实的一面让我又惊又喜。”


"He was cuter than I thought he'd be," she told CNN.


她告诉CNN：“他比我想象的还要可爱。”

Michel
is pure African Americans are descendants of African slaves. His
father was seriously ill, the family debt owed a lot of debt. But
Michel grades are very good, a way of skipping, at the age of 24
has been Harvard PhD law! When Obama was 2 years old when his
father abandoned his mother remarried to Indonesia's grandparents.
Obama and the difficulties of life to live together, rely on
student loans to complete all the studies. In this way, two poor
people began their debt of love.


米歇尔是纯正的非裔美国人，是黑奴的后代。父亲病重，家里负债累累欠了很多债。但米歇尔学习成绩非常好，一路跳级，24岁就已是哈佛的法学女博士！而奥巴马在2岁时被父亲抛弃，母亲改嫁去了印尼。奥巴马和生活困难的外祖父母一起生活，依靠助学贷款完成了全部学业。就这样，两个穷困的人开始了他们负债累累的爱情。

Chicago College of art, cinema, press the road. The Hyde Park in
London, the ice cream shop with a kiss!


没多久，两人在芝加哥第一次约会了！他们参观了芝加哥艺术学院，看了电影，压了马路。在伦敦海德公园的冰激凌店一吻定情！

Cultural. Sensitive. The fountain, nice touch. The walk,
sensitive."


“他把所有的一面都表现了出来”，米歇尔在电视里说，“他忧郁、文艺、细心。喷泉旁那是温柔的接触，散步很贴心。”


"Take tips, gentlemen," he added.“

婚礼


1992年，两人步入了婚姻的殿堂。结婚前，米歇尔带奥巴马回家见父母，丈母娘对奥巴马非常满意！


Robinson told PEOPLE in 2007. "And, you know, it just seemed like a
good match. I just think he's a nice person and I just think she
felt like he was a nice intelligent young man and she said he had a
good sense of humor."


罗宾逊在2007年告诉《人物周刊》的记者：“你看，这就是天造地设的一对儿。我只是觉得他是个好孩子，我也认为米歇尔感觉他是一个友善而优秀的年轻人，但是她说他也很幽默。”


"He was able to articulate a vision that resonated with people,
that was real," she said. "And right then and there, I decided this
guy was special. The authenticity you see is real, and that's why I
fell in love with him."


米歇尔表示：“他能够强有力的的描述远景并让人们产生共鸣，相信那些都是真的。就在那时，我认定这个男人不同凡响。你所见的即是真的，这就是我坠入爱河的原因。”


Well-matched in strength of love


势均力敌的爱情


After marriage, two people are still in love, love each other more.
Married life makes Michel more busy, on the one hand to take care
of the family, but also a career. But her career and family balance
is very good! Not a nanny, personally raising children, every day
adhere to fitness, at the same time, her career is not influenced
by Obama on his wife:


结婚后，两人依然处在热恋之中，彼此更加相爱。婚后的生活让米歇尔更加忙碌，一方面要照顾家庭，一方面还要打拼事业。但她把家庭和事业平衡的很好！不请保姆，自己亲自抚养孩子，每天坚持健身，同时她的事业也没有受到影响！奥巴马这样评论妻子：


"Michelle is a tremendously strong person, and has a very strong
sense of herself and who she is and where she comes from," he said.
"But I also think in her eyes you can see a trace of vulnerability
that most people don't know, because when she's walking through the
world she is this tall, beautiful, confident woman."


“米歇尔是个极其坚强的人，有着强烈的自我，知道自己是谁，从哪里来，”他说，“但是我觉得在她的眼里你能感到一丝很多人都感知不到的脆弱，因为她总是在人们的期望的世界里穿梭，认为她应该高高在上、美丽而又自信。”


Michel also has a deeper understanding of her husband and is
infected by her husband's virtues:


米歇尔对丈夫也有更深刻的了解，并被丈夫的优点所感染：


Michelle knew a political career could be on the horizon for her
husband, but was worried about how he'd handle it.


米歇尔找到了一条对于她丈夫来说即将出人头地的的政治生涯，但是她担忧他如何掌控。


"There is a little tension with that," she said. "I'm very wary of
politics. I think he's too much of a good guy for the kind of
brutality, the skepticism."


“我感到有一丝丝的不安，”她说，“我对政治小心翼翼。我觉得他太善良恐怕无法适应政界的残酷和猜忌。”


"Barack has helped me loosen up and feel comfortable with taking
risks, not doing things the traditional way and sort of testing it
out, because that is how he grew up," she said. “


巴拉克（奥巴马）帮助我在面对危机时放松并保持怡然自得，而不是用传统方式解决，如同通关斩将一般，因为他就是从中成长起来的，”她说。
