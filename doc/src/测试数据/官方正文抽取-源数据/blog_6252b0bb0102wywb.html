A third of adults find sharing a bed with their significant other
does them more harm than good.


　　三分之一的成年人发现，与另一半同床共枕弊大于利。


　　Winter is coming, and for those with
significant others, it’ll be a case of snugging up to them as the
weather gets colder and more inhospitable outside.


　　随着冬天的到来，天气越来越冷，室外越来越待不住，有另一半的朋友们往往会相拥入睡。


　　Supposedly.


　　这只是一种可能。


　　Of course, co-sleeping with a partner
isn’t always as effortless or pleasant as it look.


　　当然，与伴侣相拥而眠有时并不像看起来那么轻松愉悦。


　　In fact, not only can it be tricky what
with all the snoring, duvet-hogging or that awkward moment when one
of you is tipsy and late home and wholly fails to be quiet - but it
can also be potentially damaging.


　　实际上，遇到打呼噜、抢被子或一方酩酊大醉晚归且吵吵闹闹时，就不光是感觉烦恼了——有时甚至会造成潜在的危害。


　　The effects of a lack of sleep are
widespread.


　　睡眠不足危害大


　　These include causing an increase in the
risk of depression, heart disease, stroke and respiratory
failure.


　　睡眠不足会使抑郁、心脏病、中风和呼吸衰竭风险增高。


　　It can also increase the risk of
divorce. This may all sound extreme, but when you consider 29 per
cent of adults say their partner is at the root of their sleep woes
, it seems for some people there is an issue.


　　同时还会增大离婚风险。这些听起来可能有些极端，但考虑到29%的成年人称他们的伴侣是造成睡眠问题的罪魁祸首，你也许会把它当作一个严肃的问题来对待。


　　Sleep expert Dr Nerina Ramlakhan told
the MailOnline , "Almost a third of Brits say they can’t get a good
night’s sleep because they are disturbed by their
partner.


　　睡眠专家Nerina
Ramlakhan博士告诉每日邮报：“约三分之一的英国人称，伴侣的打扰导致他们睡不好觉。”


　　"So for many people it’s clear that
sleeping in separate rooms might make for a better more restful
sleep."


　　“所以对很多人来说，分房睡觉也许能够带来更高质量的睡眠。”


　　It’s rare that you find a partner with
whom your totally ’sleep compatible.’


　　“找到一个和你"睡眠模式兼容"的人非常难。”


　　A lack of ’sleep compatibility’ can also
hurt us on a cosmetic level. A study conducted by University
Hospital Case Medical Centre in Ohio found poor quality sleepers
lost 30 per cent more water 72 hours after a skin barrier
disruption (for example exposure to UV light) than those who
regularly get a good night’s sleep.


　　缺乏“睡眠兼容性”还可能损害我们的面容。一项由俄亥俄州大学医院医疗中心进行的研究发现，将皮肤暴露于干扰环境中（如紫外线）72小时后，睡眠质量较差的人会比睡眠较好的人多流失30%的水分。


　　Poor sleepers were also found to show
double the signs of aging - reduced suppleness, wrinkles and not
recovering from sunburn in the same way.


　　睡眠质量差的人还会表现出两倍的老化迹象——柔韧性降低、长皱纹以及相同方式下晒后恢复更困难。
