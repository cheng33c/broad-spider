From intimate portraits
to dramatic landscapes,
these are some of the most startling images of the natural
world.


从骇人惊魂的肖像画到戏剧性的风景画，自然界有最惊心动魄的画面。

head protectively.


这是让令人鼻子一酸的照片，沉睡中的日本恒河猴宝宝，猴妈妈的手盖在宝宝脸上保护着它。



The kingfisher frequented
this natural pond every day. The photographer used several units of
flash for the kingfisher and a continuous light to capture the wake
as the bird dived down towards the water.

snowstorm.

see the frightening, killing eyes of this four-metre-long Nile
crocodile.


尽管照片拍摄的时候得到了安全庇护，但看到四米长的尼罗河大鳄鱼摄人心魄、杀气腾腾的双眼还是不免心头一凉。

humorous behaviour.


这头母北极熊和俩幼崽在加拿大曼尼托巴瓦普斯克国家公园一起休息，突然间母熊起身突破深雪冲下山去。一只小熊跳到母熊身上，牢牢咬住住她毛茸茸的屁股——完完全全出人意料。
